# Prepare the survey and add participants

Import the template 'PLOTINA.zip' under
'Configuration' -> 'Template editor' -> 'Import'.

Import the limesurvey 'PLOTINA.lss' under
'Surveys' -> 'Create a new survey' -> 'Import'.

Check that the survey is using the template. You find this under
'Survey properties' -> 'General settings & texts' -> 'Template:'

Now start the survey. The survey will use token-based access control.

Now you can create participants for this survey. As the survey
is used a tool for collecting aggregated data, you might want to
create just one participant, namely the colleague who has collected
the data and will fill in the survey forms.
To create and invite a participant go to
'Survey participants' -> 'Create' -> 'Add participant'.

Note: As filling in the survey may take quite some time and the
session time is usually limited for the LimeSurvey instance, you
should also ask the participant(s) to save the incomplete reponse
before taking a longer break. Also ask the participants to notify
you when they have finished the survey. (You could see within
LimeSurvey when they have completed their response, but you will
not want to check every day.)

At this point the data collection can take place, independently
of most of the other steps required for visualizing the result.
