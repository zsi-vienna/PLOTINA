<h2>Description and usage of the visualization tool</h2>
<p>
  This tool visualizes the data you have inserted in the GEP monitoring tool. Per indicator, it tracks the progress made from the first measurement to the most recent (T0 to T9).
</p>
<p>
  The tool presents only those specific indicators which you have selected in the monitoring tool. The composite indicator aggregates all core and (selected) specific indicators. These merge into one number ranging from zero to one, which in its turn indicates the equality status as measured against the goals set by your RPO as well as the possibility of selecting some specific indicators and leaving others out, as well as adjustable weights. More information on the math behind can be found in the extensive documentation of this tool.
</p>
<p>
  In a pop-up window you can find the description per indicator. Please note, that for some indicators you have the opportunity to benchmark your data with the EU-wide data, as found either in She Figures 2015 or ERA Survey 2014.
</p>
<h2>To specifically fit your RPO you can adjust the visualization results!</h2>
<p>
  Each indicator is equally pre-defined with a weight of 100% (see x-axis). You have now the opportunity to self-define the weight per indicator. It automatically changes the percentage by which this affects the overall indicator. We suggest defining the weight only once at the beginning of the GEP’s progress monitoring process.
</p>
<p>
  Further, for each indicator you can define the target value you are planning to achieve (y-axis). You can change it at any time during the entire monitoring process.
</p>
<p>
  To store new default weights and threshold-levels you can download the actual instance values in the <a href="/settings">“Settings”</a> menu. To persist the new default values the downloaded file has to be deployed on the server.
